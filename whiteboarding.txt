Question #2: Array Deduping
Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.


input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi", 7, 53]

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53];

w/ recursion

function removeDuplicates(array, index= 0, result= []) {
	if (index === array.length) {
  return result;
  }
  
  check if the current element is not already in the result array
  if not it will add it to the result array
  and recursively call the function for the next element .
}


W/O recursion:

function that remove the duplicates
for loop will loop through each element in the array
it will check if the current element is not already in the result array,
if is not it will add it to the result, array.


using filter();

function removeDuplicate(array) {
	return array.filter(value, index, self) => {
  return self.indexOf(value) === index;
  }
};
